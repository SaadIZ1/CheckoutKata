Assumptions made in this solution:
Pricing rules apply to both the unit price and the special price as price of a single item can change as well.
If for instance there's a multiprice offer on 3 times and buys 6 of them, then the discount gets applied twice.
Item SKUs can only be single letters: A,B,C..Z etc
